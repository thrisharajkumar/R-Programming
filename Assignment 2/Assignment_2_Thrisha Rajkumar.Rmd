# Statistical Computing and Empirical Methods, TB1, 2024
#Assignment 2

# 1. Data Wrangling


## 1.1 (Q1) Select and filter  
(Q1). Use a combination of the select() and filter() functions to generate a data 
frame called “hSF” which is a sub-table of the original Hawks data frame, such that
1. Your data frame should include the columns:
a) “Wing”
b) “Weight”
c) “Tail”
2. Your data frame should contain a row for every hawk such that:
a) They belong to the species of Red-Tailed hawks
b) They have weight at least 1kg.
3. Use the pipe operator “%>%” to simplify your code.

## 1.1 (Q2) 

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(Stat2Data)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
#Load the Hawks data frame
data(Hawks)

#View the first few rows of the data
head(Hawks)

# Get the column headers
column_headers <- colnames(Hawks)

# Print the column headers
print(column_headers)

# Get unique species
unique_species <- unique(Hawks$Species)

# Print the unique species
print(unique_species)

ncol(Hawks) 

# Filter and select relevant columns
hSF <- Hawks %>%
  filter(Species == "RT", Weight >= 1000) %>%
  select(Wing, Weight, Tail)


# Print the filtered data
print(hSF)


```

## 1.1 (Q2)

## How many variables does the data frame hSF have?

--> In my assignment to understand the column headers in the Hawks data frame
--> Get the column headers
column_headers <- colnames(Hawks)
which provides the column names i.e. variables in a vector form.

--> ncol(Hawks) will give you the number of columns or variables in the dataframe.

```{r}
ncol(Hawks)
```

## What would you say to communicate this information to a Machine Learning Practitioner?

--> To communicate the above Information to a Machine Learning Practitoner I would mention the features or variables in use which is Species name =Red Tailed Hawks, Weight of the hawks above 1000 g / 1 kg, wing and Tail.

-->The importance of the number of variables for model complexity.

-->The choices of the variables taken for  the model performance.


## How many examples does the data frame hSF have? How many observations ? How many cases?

```{r}
num_observations <- nrow(hSF)
print(num_observations)
```

##1.2 (Q1) The arrange function
....

```{r}
sorted_hSF <- hSF %>%
  arrange(Wing)

head(sorted_hSF, 5)

```
##1.3 (Q1) Join and rename functions

(Q1). Use data.frame() to create a data frame that is called 
hawkSpeciesNameCodes and is the same as the above data frame (i.e., containing 
the correspondence between codes and the full species names).

```{r}

species_code <- c("CH", "RT", "SS")
species_name_full <- c("Cooper's", "Red-tailed", "Sharp-shinned")
hawkSpeciesNameCodes <- data.frame(species_code, species_name_full)

print(hawkSpeciesNameCodes)

```

##1.3 (Q2)

(Q2). Use a combination of the functions left_join(), the rename() and the select()
functions to create a new data frame called “hawksFullName” which is the same as 
the “Hawks” data frame except that the Species column contains the full names 
rather than the two-letter codes.

```{r}

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)


hawksFullName <- Hawks %>%
  left_join(hawkSpeciesNameCodes, by = c("Species" = "species_code")) %>%
  select(Species = species_name_full, Wing, Weight)  

print(hawksFullName)


```
## 1.3 (Q3)

Q3). Use a combination of the head() and select() functions to print out the top 
seven rows of the columns “Species”, “Wing” and “Weight” of the data frame called 
“hawksFullName”. Do this without modifying the data frame you just created. 

```{r}
head(hawksFullName, 7)


```

#Does it matter what type of join function you use here? In what situations would it make a difference?

--> Yes, Left join is the suitable join function for this dataframe creation. As Left join keeps all the rows from the lft data frame which is Hawks and addss the matching rows from the right data frame (hawksSpeciesNameCodes). If there is no match NA will be inserted for the missing values from the right data frame.

--> Left join is idea as we require all the Rows from the Hawks dataframe.




## 1.4 The mutate function
(Q1). Use the mutate(), select() and arrange() functions to create a new data 
frame called “hawksWithBMI” which has the same number of rows as the original 
Hawks data frame but only two columns - one with their Species and one with their 
“bird BMI”. Also, arrange the rows in descending order of “bird BMI”.


```{r}
# Create the hawksWithBMI data frame
hawksWithBMI <- Hawks %>%
  mutate(bird_BMI = Weight*1000 / (Wing^2)) %>%  # Calculate bird BMI
  select(Species, bird_BMI) %>%              # Select only Species and bird BMI
  arrange(desc(bird_BMI))                    # Arrange rows in descending order of bird BMI

# View the new dataframe
head(hawksWithBMI, 8)
```

##1.5 (Q1) Summarize and group-by functions

(Q1). In combination with the summarize() and the group_by functions, create a 
summary table, broken down by Hawk species, which contains the following 
summary quantities:
1. The number of rows (num_rows);
2. The average wing span in centimeters (mn_wing);
3. The median wing span in centimeters (nd_wing);
4. The trimmed average wing span in centimeters with trim=0.1, i.e., the mean 
of the numbers after the 10% largest and the 10% smallest values being 
removed (t_mn_wing);
5. The biggest ratio between wing span and tail length (b_wt_ratio).
Hint: type ?summarize to see a list of useful functions (mean, sum, etc) that can be 
used to compute the summary quantities.

```{r}
hawksSummary <- Hawks %>%
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(num_rows = n(), 
            mn_wing = mean(Wing, na.rm = TRUE),
            nd_wing = median(Wing, na.rm = TRUE),
            t_mn_wing = mean(Wing, trim = 0.1, na.rm=TRUE),
            b_wt_ratio = max(Wing/Tail, na.rm = TRUE)
              )
print(hawksSummary)
```

##1.5 (Q2) Summarize and group-by functions
(Q2). Next create a summary table of the following form: Your summary table will 
show the number of missing values, broken down by species, for the columns Wing, 
Weight, Culmen, Hallux, Tail, StandardTail, Tarsus, and Crop. You can complete this 
task by combining the select(), group_by(), summarize(), across(), everything(), 
sum() and is.na() functions.

```{r}
missingValuesSummary <- Hawks %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize( across(c(Wing, Weight, Culmen, Hallux, Tail, StandardTail, Tarsus, Crop), ~sum(is.na(.))))
#A formula that sums the number of NA values in each specified column.

# View the summary table
print(missingValuesSummary)
  
```

##2. Random experiments, events and sample spaces, and the set  theory

##2.1 Random experiments, events and sample spaces
(Q1) Firstly, write down the definition of a random experiment, event and sample 
space. This question aims to help you recall the basic concepts before completing 
the subsequent tasks.

--> 

Random experiments - It is a procedure which is either real or imaginary which has a well-defined set of possible outcomes and could (atleast in principle) be repeated arbitarily many times.

Event - An event is a set of possible outcomes of an experiments 
Sample Spaces - It is a set of all possible outcomes of interest of an experiment.


(Q2) Consider a random experiment of rolling a dice twice. Give an example of what 
is an event in this random experiment. Also, can you write down the sample space as 
a set? What is the total number of different events in this experiment? Is the empty 
set considered as an event?

Event A: Getting at least one "6" when rolling the die twice.

Sample space is all the possible outcomes
S={(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6)}

2^n
Total number of different events=2^36

Yes an empty set is considered as an event.

##2.2 Set theory
Remember that a set is just a collection of objects. All that matters for the identity of 
a set is the objects it contains. In particular, the elements within the set are 
unordered, so for example the set {1, 2, 3} is exactly the same as the set {3, 2, 1}. In 
addition, since sets are just collections of objects, each object can only be either 
included or excluded and multiplicities do not change the nature of the set. In 
particular, the set {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3} is exactly the same as the set A = {1, 2, 3}. In 
general there is no concept of “position” within a set, unlike a vector or matrix.

(Q1) Set operations:
Let the sets A, B, C be defined by A := {1, 2, 3}, B := {2, 4, 6}, C := {4, 5, 6}.
1. What are the unions 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 and 𝐴 ∪ 𝐶?
--> {1,2,3,4,6} and {1,2,3,4,5,6}

2. What are the intersections 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 and 𝐴 ∩ 𝐶?
--> {2} and {null}

3. What are the complements 𝐴 ∖ 𝐵 and 𝐴 ∖ 𝐶?
--> {1,3} and {1,2,3}
4. Are 𝐴 and 𝐵 disjoint? Are 𝐴 and 𝐶 disjoint?
--> NO and YES

5. Are 𝐵 and 𝐴 ∖ 𝐵 disjoint?
--> YES

6. Write down an arbitrary partition of {1,2,3,4,5,6} consisting of two sets. Also, 
write down another partition of {1,2,3,4,5,6} consisting of three sets.
-->
P1={{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}
P2={{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}}

(Q2) Complements, subsets and De Morgan’s laws
1. Can you give an expression for (A^c)^c without using the notion of a complement?
$$
A^c ={w \in Ω:w \notin A}
$$
2. What is 𝛺^c?
$$
(A^c)^c ={w \in Ω:w \notin A c}={w∈Ω:w∈A}=A
$$
3. (Subsets) Show that if 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵, then 𝐵𝑐 ⊆ 𝐴𝑐
Let
$$
w \in  B^c \implies w \notin B
$$
$$
w \notin A \implies w \in A^c
$$

Therefore, 
$$
B^c \subseteq A^c
$$
4. (De Morgan’s laws) Show that (𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)𝑐 = 𝐴𝑐 ∪ 𝐵𝑐. Let’s suppose we have a sequence of events 𝐴1, 𝐴2, ⋯ , 𝐴𝐾 ⊆ 𝛺. Can you write out an expression for (∩𝑘=1𝐾 𝐴𝑘)𝑐?

$$
\left( \bigcap_{k=1}^{K} A_k \right)^c = \bigcup_{k=1}^{K} A_k^c 
$$

5. (De Morgan’s laws) Show that (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)𝑐 = 𝐴𝑐 ∩ 𝐵𝑐

$$
\left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{K} A_k \right)^c = \bigcap_{k=1}^{K} A_k^c 
$$

Let’s suppose we have a sequence of events 𝐴1, 𝐴2, ⋯ , 𝐴𝐾 ⊆ 𝛺. Can you write out an expression for (∪𝑘=1𝐾 𝐴𝑘)𝑐?

$$
\left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{K} A_k \right)^c = \bigcap_{k=1}^{K} A_k^c 
$$

(Q3) Cardinality and the set of all subsets:
Suppose that 𝛺 = {𝑤1, 𝑤2, ⋯ , 𝑤𝐾} contains 𝐾 elements for some natural number 𝐾. 
Here 𝛺 has cardinality K.
Let 𝐸 be a set of all subsets of 𝛺, i.e., 𝐸 : = {𝐴|𝐴 ⊂ 𝛺}. Note that here 𝐸 is a set. Give a 
formula for the cardinality of 𝐸 in terms of 𝐾.

$$
|E| = 2^K
$$

(Q4) Disjointness and partitions.
Suppose we have a sample space 𝛺, and events 𝐴1, 𝐴2, 𝐴3, 𝐴4 are subsets of 𝛺.
1. Can you think of a set which is disjoint from every other set? That is, find a set 𝐴 ⊆ 𝛺 such that 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ for all 𝐵 ⊆ 𝛺.

--> The empty set 𝐴=∅ is disjoint from every other set, since 𝐴∩𝐵=∅ A∩B=∅ for all 𝐵⊆Ω.

2. Define events 𝑆1 : = 𝐴1, 𝑆2 = 𝐴2 ∖ 𝐴1, 𝑆3 = 𝐴3 ∖ (𝐴1 ∪ 𝐴2), 𝑆4 = 𝐴4 ∖(𝐴1 ∪ 𝐴2 ∪ 𝐴3). Show that 𝑆1, 𝑆2, 𝑆3, 𝑆4 form a partition of 𝐴1 ∪ 𝐴2 ∪ 𝐴3 ∪ 𝐴4.

--> 

Disjoint and Union proves

(Q5) Indicator function.
Suppose we have a sample space 𝛺, and the event 𝐴 is a subset of𝛺. Let 𝟏𝐴 be the indicator function of 𝐴.

1. Write down the indicator function 𝟏𝐴𝑐of 𝐴𝑐(use 𝟏𝐴 in your formula).

$$
1_A^c = 1_Ω - 1_A
$$

2. Can you find a set 𝐵 whose indicator function is 𝟏𝐴𝑐 +𝟏𝐴?

$$
B = A^c
$$
$$
1_B = 1_A^c
$$
$$
1_A^c + 1_A = 1_Ω 
$$

3. Recall that 𝟏𝐴∩𝐵 = 𝟏𝐴 ⋅ 𝟏𝐵 and 𝟏𝐴∪𝐵 = max(𝟏𝐴, 𝟏𝐵) = 𝟏𝐴 + 𝟏𝐵 − 𝟏𝐴 ⋅ 𝟏𝐵 for any 𝐴 ⊆ 𝛺 and 𝐵 ⊆ 𝛺. Combining this with the conclusion from Question (Q5) 1, use indicator functions to prove (𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)𝑐 = 𝐴𝑐 ∪ 𝐵𝑐
(De Morgan’s laws).

$$
\mathbb{1}_{(A \cap B)^c} = \mathbb{1}_{\Omega} - \mathbb{1}_{A \cap B} = 1 - \mathbb{1}_{A} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{B}
$$

Using the union of complements, we have:

$$
\mathbb{1}_{A^c \cup B^c} = \max(\mathbb{1}_{A^c}, \mathbb{1}_{B^c}) = (1 - \mathbb{1}_{A}) + (1 - \mathbb{1}_{B}) - (1 - \mathbb{1}_{A})(1 - \mathbb{1}_{B})
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\mathbb{1}_{A^c \cup B^c} = 1 - \mathbb{1}_{A} \cdot \mathbb{1}_{B}
$$

Hence, we have verified that:

$$
(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c
$$

(Q6) Uncountable infinities (this is an optional extra).
This is a challenging optional extra. You may want to return to this question once 
you have completed all other questions.
Show that the set of numbers 𝛺 : = [0,1] is uncountably infinite.


##3. Probability theory

##3.1 Rules of probability

(Q1) Construct a probability function based on the Rules of probability
Consider a sample space 𝛺 = {𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐} and a set of events ℰ = {𝐴 ⊆ 𝛺} (i.e., ℰ consists of all subsets of 𝛺). Based on the rules of probability, find a probability function 
ℙ: ℰ → [0,1] that satisfies
ℙ({𝑎, 𝑏}) = 0.6 and ℙ({𝑏, 𝑐}) = 0.5.
In your example, you need to define a function called ℙ. The function maps each event in ℰ to a number. Make sure that your function ℙ satisfies the three rules, but you don’t need to write down the proof (that it satisfies the three rules).

Let P({a}) = x, 
P({b}) = y,
P({c}) = z

x+y+z = 1, x+y =0.6, y+z = 0.5


(Q2) Verify that the following probability space satisfies the rules of probability.
Consider a setting in which the sample space 𝛺 = {0,1}, and ℰ = {𝐴 ⊆ 𝛺} ={∅,{0},{1},{0,1}}. For a fixed 𝑞 ∈ [0,1], define a function ℙ: ℰ → [0,1] by ℙ(∅) = 0, ℙ({0}) = 1 − 𝑞, ℙ({1}) = 𝑞, ℙ({0,1}) = 1.
Show that the probability space (𝛺, ℰ, ℙ) satisfies the three rules of probability.


P(∅) = 0
P({0}) = 1- q
P({1}) = q
P({0,1}) = 1

P(S) = P(∅)+P({0})+P({1})+P({0,1}) = 1
Hence all the rules of probability satisfied


## 3.2 Deriving new properties from the rules of probability
(Q1) Union of a finite sequence of disjoint events.

for an infinite sequence of pairwise disjoint events 𝐴1, 𝐴2, ⋯. Show that for a finite 
sequence of disjoint events 𝐴1, 𝐴2, ⋯ 𝐴𝑛, for any integer 𝑛 bigger than 1, the below 
equality holds as a consequence of Rule 3:
$$
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i)
$$


(Q2) Probability of a complement.
Prove that if 𝛺 is a sample space, 𝑆 ⊆ 𝛺 is an event and 𝑆𝑐:= 𝛺 ∖ 𝑆 is its complement, then we have ℙ(𝑆𝑐) = 1 − ℙ(𝑆).

$$
P(S^c) = P(\Omega \setminus S) = 1 - P(S)
$$

(Q3) The union bound
In Rule 3, for pairwise disjoint events 𝐴1, 𝐴2, ⋯, we have
Give an example of a probability space and a sequence of sets 𝑆1, 𝑆2, ⋯

$$
P(S_1 \cup S_2) < P(S_1) + P(S_2)
$$

(Q4) Probability of union and intersection of events.
Show that for events 𝐴 ⊆ 𝛺 and 𝐵 ⊆ 𝛺, we have
ℙ(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) + ℙ(𝐵) − ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$
